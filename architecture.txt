36 pieces (3 of each color, 3 of each size, 4 colors)
Each piece can either:
- Belong to the bank
- Be a discovered star
- Be part of the white binary star
- Be part of the black binary star
- Be a white ship at any of the 36 pieces
- Be a black ship at any of the 36 pieces
Giving 4 + (36 * 2) = 76 distinct possibilities for each piece.

There are four important board states:
- Whose turn (white, black) +2
- Sacrifice ability? (none, attack, move, construct, transform) +5
- Sacrifice moves left? (none, one, two, three) +4
- Movement selection active? (no, yes) +2
- Repetition count? (zero, one, two, three) +4
Giving 2 + 5 + 4 + 4 = 15 board state possibilities.

Our embedding matrix will have 76 + 15 = 91 elements.
Our sequence will have a length of 36 + 4 = 40.

The input will be flattened, normalized, and projected to the model dimension, serving as the input to a feedforward residual tower.

There are several move possibilities:
- Full-moves: attack one of 36 pieces, construct one like any of 36 pieces
- Transform: transform any of 36 pieces to one of 3 different colors
- Sacrifice initiation: sacrifice one of 36 pieces
- Movement initiation: choose which of 36 pieces to move
- Movement finish: choose which of 36 pieces to move to
- Select next piece to build homeworld with: choose one of 12 pieces
- Trigger catastrophe on any of 36 pieces
- Pass
In the event of two or more possibilities having the same outcome, only the one involving the lowest piece number will be allowed.
We will also want to add one more embedding, to be ran through tanh to produce the win probability.
This will result in (36 * 2) + (36 * 3) + (36 * 3) + 12 + 36 + 1 + 1 = a 338-dimensional output head.
